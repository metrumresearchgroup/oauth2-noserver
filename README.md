# oauth2-noserver
Simplifying the oauth2 auth flow for desktop / cli apps that have no server side.

---
While oauth works fine for apps the have a server side, I personally find it a pain to use when developing simple desktop or cli applications.  
That's why needed something to turn a complete oauth flow into a one-liner (well, that's clearly exaggerated, but it's barely more).  

So here's how it works !


# Installation

Run `go get -u github.com/metrumresearchgroup/oauth2-noserver`

Try out the included example with `make example`

# Usage

#### 1. Create an oauth app on the website/service you want to authenticate into
You must set the redirection URL to `http://127.0.0.1:14565/oauth/callback` for this library to function properly.

Once done you should get credentials (`client id` and `client secret`) to use in your code.

#### 2. From your Go program, authenticate your user like this :  

[embedmd]:# (./.docs/examples/quickstart/quickstart.go /func main/ $)
```go
func main() {
	conf := &oauth2.Config{
		ClientID:     "________________",            // also known as client key sometimes
		ClientSecret: "___________________________", // also known as secret key
		Scopes:       []string{"account"},
		Endpoint: oauth2.Endpoint{
			AuthURL:  "https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize",
			TokenURL: "https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token",
		},
	}

	client, err := oauth2ns.AuthenticateUser(conf)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// use client.Get / client.Post for further requests, the token will automatically be there
	_, _ = client.Get("/auth-protected-path")
}
```

The `AuthURL` and `TokenURL` can be found in the service's oauth documentation.

# Contexts
The Refresh functions were previously built around a timer and a shut-down. It makes more sense to just pass
a context down into those functions from a higher level with their own deadlines / timeouts.
